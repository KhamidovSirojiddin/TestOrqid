              The terms “customer", means you, your Company, your Employees, and anyone who has right or wrongful access to YOUR Azterik software or products.
                </p>

               <p class="mt-12">Ownership, possession, or license to any Azterik product or products qualifies as “using” the product.</p>

If a condition is not met, and AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP does not exercise its right to terminate, AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP still has the expressed right to terminate the agreement, if any future conditions are not met.</p>
               <p class="mt-12">If in disagreement with any of the following terms or conditions, do not use the product. Once an Azterik product or products are in use that qualifies as an agreement.</p>
               <p class="mt-12">Any rights not expressly granted herein are reserved by AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP.</p>
               <p class="mt-12 fw-900">Site License</p>
               <p class="mt-12">A customer will have possession rights to one site license, after a sufficient deposit has been processed by any registered bank in the United States or Canada, in any AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP account. Sufficient deposit is any dollar amount over $300 US, or any currency equivalent to that. Possession rights may be terminated without notice, at any time.</p>
               <p class="mt-12">A customer will have full legal right to one license to any Azterik product or products, once full payment on that particular product or products has been made.</p>
               <p class="mt-12">A license will only be used accordingly to one web site at a time. You may switch web sites, but at no time be able to use any Azterik product or products simultaneously with one or more sites.</p>
                <p class="mt-12 fw-900">Disclaimer of Warranty for Azterik Products</p>
               <p class="mt-12">Any Azterik Product or products are provided "as is" and without any warranties expressed or implied. In no event shall AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP, or its subsidiaries be liable for any damages whatsoever (including, without limitation, lost profits, business interruption or lost information) resulting from the use of or inability to use the software.</p>
                <p class="mt-12 fw-900">Errors on Our Website</p>
               <p class="mt-12">Despite our efforts to ensure that the information on our website is accurate, complete and current, there may be instances when information about a Product contains inaccurate or incomplete data, including data about the Product's price or availability. We make no warranty or guarantee that the information on our website is error-free, complete, or current.

                <p class="mt-12 fw-900">Limitations and Exclusions</p>
               <p class="mt-12">We reserve the right to change Product pricing, terms, specifications and warranties without notice. In addition, we may revise these terms of use at any time by updating the website. We reserve the right to limit the number of Products sold, including the right to prohibit sales to re-sellers. Prices do not include shipping, tax or insurance. We do not review or edit any portion of gift messages and disclaim all responsibility for their content. We disclaim all responsibility for the accuracy of any map or direction presented on our website.</p>
                <p class="mt-12">You may not use any Azterik Products or product to rent, lease, and license, grant a security interest in, or otherwise transfer or sublicense your rights to any third party.</p>
               <p class="mt-12 fw-900">Damages</p>
                 <p class="mt-12">In no event shall AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP, its subsidiaries or affiliates, or their respective officers, directors, employees, representatives or agents be liable for special, incidental, consequential, punitive, indirect, or other special damages, including but not limited to, loss of data, use, or profits, however caused, whether for breach of contract, negligence, or otherwise, and whether or not we have been advised of the possibility of any such damages.</p>
               <p class="mt-12 fw-900">Payment Types We Accept Online</p>
                <p class="mt-12">We accept the following forms of payment for your online purchases: MasterCard, Visa, e-check, cash, check, money order and Paypal. For your online purchases, you may purchase multiple products in a single order.</p>
               <p class="mt-12">We do accept online-only or virtual credit cards as long as they are issued by one of the credit card companies listed above. However, due to the requirements of these companies, these cards can only be used for website orders that are shipped. We do not accept online-only or virtual cards as a form of payment on Express Pickup orders.</p>
                  <p class="mt-12 fw-900">Online Statement</p>
                <p class="mt-12">If the customer is financing any Azterik product or products, they agree that the Online Statement is the only statement that needs to be provided to them. AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP will use reasonable efforts to correct any technical failures within a reasonable time. Inability to view an online statement does not relieve any obligation on the customer’s part to make a required monthly payment or balance owing.</p>
               <p class="mt-12 fw-900">Late Charges</p>
                  <p class="mt-12">The amount due to AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP must be paid in full by the date such payment is requested by AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP. Monthly payment under a finance plan, qualifies as “must be paid in full”, and does not suggest in any way, shape or form the balance of the total amount due. Total payment is due on the date specified by the date requested by AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP.</p>
                <p class="mt-12">You may carry forward a balance.</p>
               <p class="mt-12">YOU agree to pay late charges that may be assessed by AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP on amounts due but not timely paid. The late charge will be no less than 1.5% per day. Increase in percentage does not require consent from the customer, and no notice is required.</p>
                  <p class="mt-12">AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP reserves the right to refer your billing account to a third party for collection in the event of default. You agree to pay all costs incurred in the enforcement of these Terms of Use and in collection of any delinquent amounts due, including reasonable attorneys' fees and costs.</p>
                <p class="mt-12">At any time a payment is late, AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP reserves the express right to claim full possession of the particular product in question.</p>
               <p class="mt-12">At any time a payment is late, AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP reserves the right to terminate the agreement in regards to the particular product in question. Accepting a prior late payment and not exercising this right, does not change AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP’ future right to terminate the agreement, if a future payment is late.</p>
                <p class="mt-12 fw-900">Current and Future Liability</p>
                <p class="mt-12">The customer must agree to defend, indemnify and hold AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP and its suppliers harmless from and against any and all claims, losses, liability costs and expenses (including but not limited to attorneys' fees) arising from your violation of these Terms and Conditions, or any third-party's rights, (including, without limitation, infringement of any copyright, violation of any proprietary right and invasion of any privacy rights). These obligations will survive any termination of agreement between you the customer and AZTERIK MEDIA GROUP.</p>
